# EmEn project

EmEn project is final project in Coders Lab bootcamp and first code written in React.
Its a landing page for the hostel.

## Description

EmEn project is React landing page made with help of Sass.
There is a lack of react tehnology,because there were used only state less components.
Still,with a help of Sass I wanted to write code which will be "easy to change",because all UI settings are in one file.
In the moment of writing this readme my skils in React are much better,so I hope that in the future this project will be finished.

## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces 
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Sass: CSS with superpowers
* [HTML](http://www.html.com) - HTML: HyperText Markup Language


## Getting Started

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


## Project status

For now it is simple landing page with use of React and Sass.
In the future can be added
